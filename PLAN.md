# Steel Snob Revival Plan: 0 → 10K Monthly Visitors in 90 Days

## Site Audit Summary

### What We Have
- **Domain:** steelsnob.com (aged, some existing authority)
- **Content:** ~30 articles across 6 categories
- **SEO Plugin:** Rank Math (sitemaps working)
- **Affiliate:** Amazon Associates active (tag: steelsnob06-20)
- **Categories:** Guides/Info, Combat, Outdoors, Kitchen, Knife Laws, Steel Type

### What's Wrong
1. **Dead content** - Most articles are from 2019-2022, never updated
2. **Thin content** - Articles are decent but not competitive for 2026 SEO
3. **No E-E-A-T signals** - No author bio, no "About" page, no expertise demonstration
4. **Broken affiliate links** - Amazon product links from 2019-2022 likely pointing to discontinued products
5. **No internal linking strategy** - Articles exist in isolation
6. **No email list** - Zero audience retention mechanism
7. **Missing topical authority** - Content is scattered, no deep coverage of any topic cluster

---

## Strategy Overview

The plan has 3 pillars:

1. **Fix the foundation** (Week 1-2) - Technical SEO, site structure, E-E-A-T
2. **Content machine** (Ongoing) - 40+ articles in 90 days targeting specific keyword clusters
3. **Distribution & links** (Week 3+) - Programmatic outreach, social, community presence

### Traffic Math
To hit 10K/month organic:
- ~50 articles ranking on page 1
- Average 200 visits/month per article
- OR 20 articles at 500 visits/month (bigger keywords)
- Mix of quick-win long-tail + competitive medium-tail keywords

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Technical SEO Audit & Fixes
- [ ] Verify Google Search Console ownership
- [ ] Submit updated sitemap
- [ ] Check Core Web Vitals (PageSpeed Insights)
- [ ] Fix any crawl errors / broken links
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Install/verify Google Analytics 4
- [ ] Set up rank tracking (free: Google Search Console / paid: Ahrefs Lite or SE Ranking)
- [ ] Verify Rank Math settings are optimal (see seo/technical-audit.md)

### 1.2 Site Structure & E-E-A-T
- [ ] Create proper "About Steel Snob" page - establish expertise
- [ ] Add author bio with knife/steel credentials to all articles
- [ ] Create "How We Test" / "Our Methodology" page
- [ ] Add clear navigation: Home > Category > Article
- [ ] Redesign homepage to showcase content (not just empty categories)
- [ ] Add breadcrumbs (Rank Math handles this)
- [ ] Create a proper footer with sitemap links, about, privacy policy, affiliate disclosure

### 1.3 Update All Existing Content (HIGH PRIORITY)
This is the fastest path to traffic. Existing indexed pages have aged authority.

For each of the ~30 existing articles:
- [ ] Update title & meta description for current year (2026)
- [ ] Refresh all Amazon product links (replace discontinued products)
- [ ] Add/update product pricing
- [ ] Expand thin sections (target 2000+ words for buyer guides)
- [ ] Add comparison tables (using Rank Math Table of Contents or plugin)
- [ ] Add FAQ schema (Rank Math supports this natively)
- [ ] Improve images (add alt text, compress, add custom graphics)
- [ ] Add internal links to related articles
- [ ] Update publish date after significant updates

**Priority articles to update first** (highest traffic potential):
1. `best-kitchen-knife-set` - Huge volume keyword
2. `best-nakiri-knife` - Strong buyer intent
3. `best-throwing-knives` - Enthusiast niche, good volume
4. `best-kershaw-knife` - Brand-specific, loyal audience
5. `fixed-blade-hunting-knives` - High CPC, outdoor audience
6. `knife-sharpening` - Informational, massive search volume
7. `knives-blades` - Educational pillar content
8. `knife-handle-material` - Technical, links to many topics

## Phase 2: Content Machine (Weeks 2-12)

### Content Strategy: Topical Authority Clusters

Instead of random articles, we build **topic clusters** that signal to Google we're THE authority on knives and steel.

#### Cluster 1: Knife Steel Guides (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
This is where "Steel Snob" has a natural brand advantage. Steel comparisons are searched heavily by knife enthusiasts.

**Pillar:** "Complete Guide to Knife Steel Types" (5000+ words)

**Supporting articles (Steel vs Steel comparisons):**
- S30V vs S35VN - Which Is Better?
- MagnaCut vs M390 - The Ultimate Comparison
- VG-10 vs S30V - Budget vs Premium
- D2 Steel vs S30V
- 154CM vs S30V
- 440C vs VG-10
- CPM 3V vs CPM 4V
- AUS-8 vs 8Cr13MoV - Budget Steel Showdown
- Damascus Steel - Is It Worth The Hype?
- What Is Powder Metallurgy Steel?

**Why this works:** Each "X vs Y" article targets a specific long-tail keyword with low competition but consistent monthly searches (100-1,000/mo each). Knife enthusiasts Google these constantly. Collectively they can drive 3,000-5,000 visits/month.

#### Cluster 2: Kitchen Knives (HIGHEST VOLUME)
Kitchen knife keywords have the largest search volume in the knife niche.

**Pillar:** "Complete Kitchen Knife Guide - Everything You Need" (5000+ words)

**Supporting articles:**
- Best Chef's Knife Under $50 / $100 / $200 (3 articles)
- Best Japanese Kitchen Knives (2026)
- Santoku vs Chef's Knife - Which Should You Buy?
- German vs Japanese Kitchen Knives
- Best Knife Sets for Beginners
- How to Choose a Kitchen Knife
- Best Bread Knives (2026)
- Best Paring Knives (2026)
- Best Cleaver for Home Kitchen

#### Cluster 3: Knife Care & Maintenance (HIGH SEARCH VOLUME)
- How to Sharpen a Knife with a Whetstone (Step-by-Step)
- Best Knife Sharpeners (2026) - Electric vs Manual
- How to Hone a Knife (Most People Do It Wrong)
- How to Clean and Maintain Carbon Steel Knives
- Best Knife Storage Solutions (Blocks, Magnetic Strips, Drawer Inserts)
- How to Remove Rust from a Knife Blade

#### Cluster 4: Knife Laws by State (PROGRAMMATIC CONTENT)
The site already has a "Knife Laws" category. This is a goldmine for programmatic content.

**Generate 50 state-specific articles:**
- Knife Laws in Texas - What You Can Carry
- Knife Laws in California - Complete Guide
- Knife Laws in Florida...
- (etc.)

**Why:** Each state article targets "[state] knife laws" - a keyword with 500-5,000 monthly searches per state. Low competition, high intent, and EACH article can link to product recommendations. This cluster alone could drive 5,000+ visits/month.

#### Cluster 5: EDC & Outdoor Knives (ENTHUSIAST AUDIENCE)
- Best EDC Knives (2026)
- Best Pocket Knives Under $50
- Best Bushcraft Knives
- Best Survival Knives
- Fixed Blade vs Folding Knife - Which Is Right For You?
- Best Knife Brands Ranked (2026)
- Best Benchmade Knives
