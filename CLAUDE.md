# Steel Snob - AI Context

## Project Overview
Revival of steelsnob.com - a knife niche site with ~30 existing articles from 2019-2022.
Target: 10K monthly organic visitors within 3 months through content + SEO.

## Current Site State
- WordPress + Rank Math SEO
- Amazon Associates (tag: steelsnob06-20)
- Categories: Guides/Info, Combat, Outdoors, Kitchen, Knife Laws, Steel Type
- Content quality: Mid - needs updating for 2026 E-E-A-T standards
- Domain is aged (good authority foundation)

## Key Decisions
- Focus on kitchen knives + knife steel content (highest search volume, best affiliate potential)
- Programmatic content for steel type comparisons (X vs Y)
- Update all existing articles before writing new ones

## Status
- Phase: Month 1 planning complete, execution pending
- WordPress access needed from Dror
