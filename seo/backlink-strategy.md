# Backlink Strategy - Steel Snob

## Phase 1: Foundation Links (Month 1)

### Directory Submissions
- Submit to knife/outdoor niche directories
- Submit to general web directories (BOTW, DMOZ alternatives)
- Create profiles on knife forums with site link

### Content-Based Links
- Create a shareable "Knife Steel Comparison Chart" (infographic/interactive tool)
- Publish a data-driven study ("We Analyzed 500 Amazon Knife Reviews - Here's What We Found")
- Guest post opportunities on cooking/outdoor blogs

## Phase 2: Community & Outreach (Month 2-3)

### Reddit Strategy (NO SPAM)
Target subreddits:
- r/knives (2M+ members)
- r/knifeclub (400K+)
- r/chefknives (200K+)
- r/BudgetBlades (100K+)
- r/sharpening (50K+)
- r/Bladesmith (50K+)
- r/EDC (1M+)
- r/Cooking (25M+)
- r/AskCulinary

**Rules:**
- Contribute genuinely for 2+ weeks before ever linking
- Only link when truly helpful and relevant
- Create original content for Reddit (not just blog reposts)
- Engage in discussions, answer questions

### Forum Presence
- BladeForums.com - create profile, contribute to discussions
- KitchenKnifeForums.com
- CandlePowerForums (crossover EDC audience)

### Outreach
- HARO / Connectively - respond to cooking/outdoor/safety queries
- Reach out to YouTube knife reviewers for collaboration
- Contact cooking bloggers for "best knife" roundups

## Phase 3: Scalable Link Building (Month 3+)

### Resource Page Link Building
- Find "best knife resources" pages and request inclusion
- Find "cooking resources" pages that could add knife content
- Find state government pages about knife laws (cite them, then outreach)

### Broken Link Building
- Find broken links on knife/cooking sites pointing to dead pages
- Offer our content as replacement

### Digital PR
- Publish annual "State of Knife Steel" report
- Create a free online tool (Knife Steel Finder / Knife Law Checker)
- Tools naturally attract links from forums, blogs, and reference pages

## Link Building KPIs
- Month 1: 10-20 links (directories, forum profiles, initial outreach)
- Month 2: 20-30 links (content marketing, community engagement)
- Month 3: 30-50 links (outreach at scale, tool/resource links)

## DO NOT
- Buy links from PBNs
- Use link farms or link exchange networks
- Spam forums or Reddit
- Use automated outreach tools for bulk emailing
- Create fake guest post profiles
