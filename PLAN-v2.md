# Steel Snob Revival Plan v2 - REVISED After Full Audit

## What Changed From v1

The site has **178 articles**, not 30. This fundamentally changes the strategy:

| | v1 Plan (Assumed) | v2 Plan (Actual) |
|---|---|---|
| Existing content | ~30 articles | **178 articles** |
| Knife Laws | Write 50 new | **Already have all 50 states** |
| Kitchen articles | Write 10+ | **Already have 36** |
| Steel Type guides | Write 10+ | **Already have 12** |
| Strategy | Write 70 new articles | **Refresh 178 + write 20-30 targeted new** |

**This is much better.** Refreshing existing indexed content beats writing new articles every time. Google already knows these URLs. We just need to make them competitive again.

## Revised 90-Day Strategy

### PILLAR 1: Content Refresh Blitz (Weeks 1-6) - THE MAIN EVENT

This is 70% of the work. Refresh all 178 articles in priority order.

#### What "refresh" means for each article:
1. **Update title** - add current year, improve CTR
2. **Update meta description** - Rank Math focus keyword + compelling copy
3. **Refresh product recommendations** - replace dead Amazon links, add 2026 products
4. **Expand thin content** - target 1,500w minimum, 2,500w+ for buyer guides
5. **Add FAQ section** - 3-5 questions with Rank Math FAQ schema
6. **Add comparison tables** - for any "best X" articles
7. **Improve internal links** - link to related articles in each cluster
8. **Update images** - add alt text, compress, add at least 1 new image
9. **Add author bio snippet** - E-E-A-T signal
10. **Change "last updated" date** - signals freshness to Google

#### Refresh Priority Order:

**WAVE 1 (Week 1-2): Knife Laws - 50 articles**
Why first? Programmatic and templated - fastest to batch-update. Highest combined search volume (30K-50K/mo across all states). Laws change frequently so Google rewards fresh content.

Each state article needs:
- Verify laws are current for 2026 (state legislatures update annually)
- Add structured summary box at top
- Add FAQ schema
- Add internal links to related states and the US Knife Laws overview
- Update date
- ~30 min per article at scale

**WAVE 2 (Week 3-4): Kitchen Knives - 36 articles**
Why second? Highest affiliate revenue potential. Replace all outdated 2022 product picks with current 2026 models.

Key updates:
- All "Best X" articles need new top picks with current Amazon links
- Add price comparison tables
- Expand buying guide sections
- Update year in title ("Best Kitchen Knife Set 2026")
- Add "What We Look For" section (E-E-A-T)

**WAVE 3 (Week 4-5): Steel Type - 12 articles + Guides - 52 articles**
Steel Type articles are the brand identity. Expand each:
- Add comparison to newer steels (MagnaCut, Magnacut, CPM MagnaCut)
- Add "Best knives in X steel" product picks (affiliate opportunity)
- Interlink all steel articles to each other

Guides - prioritize by traffic potential:
- Sharpening guides (huge volume)
- Knife identification/value articles
- How-to articles (sharpen, clean, maintain)

**WAVE 4 (Week 5-6): Outdoors + Combat - 32 articles**
- Update all "Best X of 2022" titles to 2026
- Refresh product recommendations
- Add affiliate links where missing

#### Refresh Schedule:
| Week | Articles | Category |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | 25 knife law articles | Knife Laws batch 1 |
| 2 | 25 knife law articles | Knife Laws batch 2 |
| 3 | 18 kitchen articles | Kitchen batch 1 |
| 4 | 18 kitchen + 12 steel | Kitchen batch 2 + Steel Type |
| 5 | 26 guides | Guides batch 1 |
| 6 | 26 guides + 23 outdoor + 9 combat | Everything else |

## Execution Method

For the content refresh blitz, I'll use AI-assisted batch processing:
1. Pull article content via WP API
2. Research current data (laws, products, prices)
3. Generate updated content
4. Push back via WP API
5. Human review spot-check on batches

For new articles:
1. Keyword research confirms opportunity
2. Write with article template
3. Publish via WP API
4. Add internal links to/from existing content

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ WordPress API connected
2. ✅ Full content inventory complete (178 articles)

4. ⬜ Dror: Verify Google Search Console access working
5. ⬜ Start Wave 1: Knife Laws refresh (batch of 50)
6. ⬜ Create About page + author bios
7. ⬜ Audit homepage and fix the empty state
